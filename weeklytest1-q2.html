                    <p>
                        You can decide what you want to do in life,
                         but I suggest doing something that creates. 
                         Something that leaves a tangible thing once you're done.
                          That way even after you're gone, you will still live on 
                          in the things you created.It was a weird concept. Why would I really
                           need to generate a random paragraph? Could I actually learn something
                            from doing so? All these questions were running through her head as she 
                            pressed the generate button. To her surprise, she found what she least expected
                             to see.

                                is something hiding under your bed. You want to look, 
                                but you don't at the same time. You're frozen with fear
                                and unable to act. That's where she found herself and 
                                she didn't know what to do next</p>

                                 He never was, but he had promised this one time. 
                                 She had made him repeat the promise multiple times over the

                             He awoke at the same time, ate the same breakfast and 
                             drove the same commute. He worked at a job that never seemed 
                             to change and he got home at 6 pm sharp every night. It was who
                              he had been for the last ten years and he had no idea that was all about to change.</p>

                        <p>They argue. While the argument seems to be
                             different the truth is it's always the same. Yes, the
                              topic may be different or the circumstances, but when all said 
                              and done, it all came back to the same thing. They both knew it,
                               but neither has the courage or strength to address the underlying issue. So they continue to argue.</p>
